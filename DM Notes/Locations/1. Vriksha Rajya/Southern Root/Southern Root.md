#Location #Province 

The [[Southern Root]] is especially known for its mining endeavours. There is a mountain range that splits the root in two pieces. The upper half does a lot of the exportation of metals and minerals to mainly the [[Eastern Root]]. 

The lower half is where most the smiths reside that work to forge things out of the metals found in the [[Sangri-La Mountain range]]
