#Location #Province 

The [[DM Notes/Locations/1. Vriksha Rajya/Southern Root/Southern Root]] is especially known for its mining endeavours. There is a mountain range that splits the root in two pieces. The upper half does a lot of the exportation of metals and minerals to mainly the [[DM Notes/Locations/1. Vriksha Rajya/Eastern Root/Eastern Root]]. 

The lower half is where most the smiths reside that work to forge things out of the metals found in the [[DM Notes/Locations/1. Vriksha Rajya/Southern Root/Sangri-La Mountain range]]
