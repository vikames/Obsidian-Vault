#History  #VrikshaRajya

In the middle of [[Vriksha Rajya]], lies a tree that spans the continent. The tree's roots are visible from on the roads and the native people have decided to take it as waymarkers, making getting lost harder. Cities are found around the roots and have cleverly used the big roots to their advantage. One city uses the loop that the root has made as their city walls. Up above there are lights that are visible. Aside from that, it is possible to move under the root to go inside the city.

Only parts of the tree that fell off naturally are allowed to be used for other purposes legally

Vidya Vriksha is a city in and of itself. From the outside, you see that the leaves shine with an almost fluorescent nature to them. In the night, the leaves turn this somewhat gold coloration. The inside looks like a hollowed out tree with different tree houses on the interior walls of the tree. The people of tree have learned to work with solar energy. The tree that is on the inside sometimes drops seeds. There a cultivated in saplings that have been used as torches. A lot of the infrastructure around [[Vriksha Rajya]] uses their [[sapling torches]] to create light. Similarly to the tree, they need to absorb sunlight during the daya and then exert sunlight in the night. Whenever there was a storm or it was particularly cloudy, then the tree glows dimly.



During the day, the outside of the tree is dormant. The leaves are green, yellow, red, depeding on the season but do not give off light. On the inside, the flow of soul can be see going from the leaves to the bottom. The whole city infrastructure goes to sleep. While there are still security guards and the like, most shops and government buildings close. The vast majority of the people sleep during the day and are awake during the night. They do similar jobs to those who would live in a normal sleep cycle.  Those who live during the day work outside of the tree to farm, trade or tourism as most visitors are not used to the peculiar cycle. 
During the night, the tree lights up with sun-like golden color, from bark to leaves. On the inside there is almost a smaller tree at in the center of the center of the city that lights up very brightly.
