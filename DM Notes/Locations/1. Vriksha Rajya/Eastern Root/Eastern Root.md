#Province #Location

The [[Eastern Root]] is mostly known for fish and travel by boat. [[Chandrakona]] gives a fast connection to [[Te Waipounamu]] and [[Zankoku]], even [[Mahilaya Archipelago]] if necessary.






Closest to the [[Vidya Vriksha]] is the gate city. The [[gate cities]] make it possible to switch to the other side of the root. 

The third dot is the location where the root becomes easy to ride over with horse and cart called [[split cities]].
