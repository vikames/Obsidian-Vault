#Location #Province

The [[Northern Root]] is the one lies closest to the border of [[Al-Maghrib Al-Wafir]]. 

Trade is a central point in the Northern root. In bigger cities like [[Northern Root gate city]] and [[Northern Root Split village]], there are a lot traders from [[Al-Maghrib Al-Wafir]].

Because of this, the general wealth of every town is at least passable to nice.

All the way to the north are [[trading villages]].
