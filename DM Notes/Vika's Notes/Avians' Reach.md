Aster's village is in Sangri-La Mountain range. It is called Avian's Reach. The name conveys a sense of the village reaching high into the skies, where the avian inhabitants make their homes among the clouds. The village is on a ridge of the mountain, tactically chosen as non-flying creatures rarely get so high in the mountains.

Talons - bird claws.
