Aster's beloved pet lemming is called Pebble. This small, grey-furred creature is aptly named after the smooth, stone-like appearance of his coat. Aster met Pebble in the mountain range while exploring. They didn't get close at first but after seeing each other many times, they started "talking." Pebble followed Aster into the village, but some of the villagers did not like the idea of a little loud lemming intruding their homes, so Aster started carrying Pebble in her pocket. The name Pebble may be diminutive in stature, but his personality is anything but. He's a lemming with a whole lot of sass packed into his tiny frame.

Pebble's territorial nature is quite pronounced, and he takes his role as Aster's loyal companion very seriously. He's fiercely protective of her and isn't the least bit interested in sharing her attention. Whether it's perched on her shoulder as she explores the mountains or nestled in her pocket, Pebble is always close by, ensuring that he's the undisputed center of his world, which revolves around Aster.

Despite his sassy demeanor, Pebble's loyalty and affection for Aster are unwavering. He may give others the side-eye or the occasional nip if they get too close to his beloved companion, but his bond with Aster is unbreakable. Together, they navigate the world with confidence, and Pebble's territorial tendencies serve as a humorous reminder of the unique relationship they share.
