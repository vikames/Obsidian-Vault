Aarakocra mountain circle druid
## Backstory
**Vika’s character**: Aster

**Aster’s mother**: [[DM Notes/Vika's Notes/Shale]] (inspired by shale, a layered rock that is often seen in mountain ranges).

**Aster’s teacher**: [[Lenti]] (Lenticular: Lenticular clouds are unique to mountainous areas and form in the lee of mountains where moist air flows over the peaks. They have a lens or saucer-shaped appearance and can sometimes look like UFOs due to their smooth and elongated structure).

**Backstory**:

Aster was born into a small and secluded Aarakocra village nestled high in the mountains. Her village was known for its strong connection to nature and its skilled druids who maintained harmony between the elements and the creatures that lived there. Her mother, Shale, was a respected elder of the village and a powerful druid herself. Shale's nurturing nature led her to raise Aster with a unique belief system that would shape the young Aarakocra's life.

From an early age, Shale instilled in Aster the belief that the natural world was beautiful, but it also held many secrets and dangers. She taught Aster to respect all creatures and understand their role in the ecosystem. Strangely, she had an unconventional approach to strengthening Aster's immune system. Aster's mother secretly fed her cockroaches, claiming they were rich in nutrients and essential for her health. This resulted in Aster developing an ironic fear of cockroaches, even though they were meant to be beneficial for her.

As Aster grew, her curiosity about the world around her blossomed. She would spend hours watching the wildlife and learning the ancient ways of her people from the village elders. Despite her young age, she was surprisingly stealthy and cunning, often eavesdropping on conversations meant for adult ears only. This led to her mother getting Aster druid lessons from an old friend called Lenti. He taught her most of her childhood and became close to the family.

One day, when Aster was exploring the outskirts of the village, she witnessed a group of hunters from a neighboring human settlement encroaching upon the sacred grounds of her people. Intrigued and concerned, she followed the hunters, hoping to learn more about their intentions. She knew she was not supposed to do this, but she had a bit of rebellion in her when she felt like she has to be. To her horror, she discovered that they were planning to capture some of the rare and mystical creatures that lived in the mountains, intending to sell them in distant markets.

Unable to stand idly by Aster knew she had to take action. She returned to her village and sought counsel from her mother and the village elders even though she knew this rebellious adventure of hers would not be taken lightly. However, the elders saw the importance of the situation and aided her with this plan. With their guidance, she hatched a plan to thwart the hunters' efforts. Using her agility and druidic abilities, Aster managed to outwit the hunters and lead the mystical creatures to safety.

This act of bravery and cunning impressed the elders, and it became clear to them that Aster had a special bond with nature and a keen understanding of its delicate balance. They saw in her the potential to become a great druid and guardian of their village.

As time went on, Aster honed her druidic skills under the guidance of her mother and other elders. She developed a deep appreciation for the natural world, fostering a strong connection with the animals and plants around her. While she remained naive in some aspects due to her sheltered upbringing, her curiosity and adventurous spirit never waned.

Now, at the adult age of six (considered young even among her Arakocra peers), Aster is ready to venture beyond her village to explore the wider world. She seeks to discover more about different cultures, learn from other druids, and protect nature wherever she goes. While she carries the teachings of her mother and her village in her heart, she is open to new experiences and interpretations of the world.

Aster's alignment leans towards chaotic good, as she values individual freedom and will do what she believes is right, even if it means breaking rules or traditions to achieve it. She is motivated by her desire to protect nature and the creatures she loves, making her a force to be reckoned with in the name of environmental preservation.

And so, with her wooden staff in hand, adorned with feathers and natural elements, Aster sets out on her journey, ready to embrace the wonders and challenges of the world with her curiosity, stealth, and cunning by her side.

Of course, her mother wouldn’t want Aster to go into the world all alone for the first time. Because of that Aster’s teacher Liri is being sent with her to protect and guide her. He has taught her from a young age and is treated like a family member.

Although Aster did want to get to know the outside world, she had a secret plan up her sleeve. While she did save the animals that were in danger from the hunters, she knew they wouldn’t stop there. The only way to stop this was to destroy the whole system. As Shale wouldn’t be happy to find out her daughter is planning to take down a whole black market.

Aster believes she can understand and communicate with nature in a more profound way. While she does have a genuine connection to the natural world through her druidic abilities, she often interprets the responses of animals and plants in a funny manner.

For instance:

1. Animated Conversations: When Aster speaks with animals, she'll engage in full conversations, using different voices for each animal and responding as if she understands every nuance of their "speech." Her companions will find themselves amused as Aster tries to relay the squirrels' latest gossip or the birds' thoughts on the weather.

2. Plants with Personalities: Aster believes that plants have unique personalities and feelings. She might talk to them, compliment their beauty, or apologize for stepping on a twig. She could even have a "favorite" tree in the forest and spend a few moments every day talking to it.

3. Casting Spells with Flair: Whenever Aster casts druidic spells, she'll add dramatic gestures and poetic incantations, believing that the natural elements respond better when they're entertained.

4. Cunning Conversations with Cockroaches: Despite her fear of cockroaches, Aster might try to negotiate with them during encounters, asking them to "please not chase her" or "go bother someone else."

This belief in her ability to communicate with nature can lead to moments of hilarity or trouble. It also reinforces her naivety, showing that she sees the world through a lens of innocence and wonder.

Aster was born into a small and secluded Arakocra village nestled high in the mountains. [[Avians' Reach]] was known for its strong connection to nature and its skilled druids who maintained harmony between the elements and the creatures that lived there. Her mother, [[DM Notes/Vika's Notes/Shale]], was a respected elder of the village and a powerful druid herself. Kaela's nurturing nature led her to raise Liri with a unique belief system that would shape the young Arakocra's life.

From an early age, Kaela instilled in Liri the belief that the natural world was beautiful, but it also held many secrets and dangers.

## Other

I like this "As Liri begins to explore her druidic abilities, she encounters a mentor figure—perhaps an older, trickster-like Druid or a clever and secretive creature from the mountains. This mentor recognizes Liri's mischievous nature and decides to guide her by channeling her skills toward useful purposes.

Liri's mentor teaches her how to enhance her stealth and cunning, honing her skills to sneak past guards, find hidden paths in the mountains, and use her talents to gather information or procure essential resources for her village."

"maybe the village has some agenda or needs info to defend against the humans"

"ooooor she talked her mom into sending her to a relative in the city. But she only convinced her to do so becase she overheard the humans talking that that is where the main sales are"

"oh I was gonna say maybe a [[Lemming Pebble]] cuz they are in the mountains"
