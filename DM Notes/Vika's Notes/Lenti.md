### Appearance
He is a Great Horned Owl Aarakocra with brown feathers that seem to be graying at the tips. He has a scar over his eye that makes him incapable of looking through it. While he is quite strong, he is also tired quickly from the injuries he has endured. 

He wears a leather vest that does not obscure his wings and a pendant for his druidic focus.
### Background

The teacher of [[Avians' Reach]], he was assigned to teach [[Aster]] by her mother Shale. He is like a family member to [[Aster]] and [[DM Notes/Vika's Notes/Shale]]. 

In the secluded Aarakocra village perched high in the craggy peaks of the mountains, a tale of resilience and wisdom unfolded. Lenti, an avian of another village, had found solace and a new home in the welcoming embrace of Shale's village. [[DM Notes/Vika's Notes/Shale]] herself had been a guiding light in this acceptance, having a heart as vast as the mountain ranges that surrounded their haven. When Lenti arrived, he brought with him stories of another village, now a distant memory tarnished by tragedy.

Lenti's own village had fallen victim to the relentless cruelty of human hunters. Their once-thriving community had been torn asunder by the relentless pursuit of exotic creatures. Many of his friends and family had perished in that fateful assault. With a heavy heart and memories that haunted him, he had set out in search of a new sanctuary.

Shale, ever perceptive and empathetic, sensed the pain that Lenti carried with him. She recognized his wisdom, his inner strength, and the patient resilience that had allowed him to survive such a devastating loss. In this damaged traveller, she saw an opportunity for hope and growth.

It was not long before Shale invited Lenti to become part of their village, offering him a place among their people, extending the warm wing of acceptance that only the Aarakocra could understand. It was this act of compassion and unity that bridged the gap between Lenti and Shale's village.

For a time, Lenti lived among his new kin, contributing to their way of life and sharing the knowledge of the mountains. His days were spent perched on rocky ledges, observing the natural world with the same patience and wisdom that had drawn Shale to him. He marvelled at the resilient flora and fauna that adorned the slopes and peaks, understanding the delicate balance of their ecosystem.

As seasons passed, Lenti's bond with Shale and her daughter, Aster, deepened. He felt a calling to take on a role beyond that of an observer; he wanted to share his insights, knowledge, and resilience with the younger generation. This desire did not go unnoticed by Shale, who recognized the potential for Lenti to be a mentor, especially for her spirited and inquisitive daughter, Aster.

Thus, Shale assigned Lenti the role of teacher, a decision that would shape the destinies of Aster, Lenti, and the entire village. As Aster's mentor, Lenti's calm and patient nature provided the perfect guidance for her young and curious mind. His wisdom, born from the ashes of tragedy, was an invaluable resource as he imparted the teachings of the mountains, emphasizing harmony with nature and the importance of patience and cleverness in facing life's challenges.

In Lenti's presence, Aster found a patient and wise mentor, one who could provide answers to her many questions and offer guidance as she developed her druidic abilities. She also found a source of humor and lightheartedness in Lenti's witty jokes and clever anecdotes. In her, Lenti recognized the potential for a new beginning, a chance to nurture a young druid who could carry forward the teachings of their people.

Together, Lenti and Aster embarked on a journey of learning, adventure, and discovery. And as they soared through the mountain skies, they carried with them the memories of their shared pasts and the hope for a future filled with wisdom, patience, and the enduring spirit of their mountain home.
