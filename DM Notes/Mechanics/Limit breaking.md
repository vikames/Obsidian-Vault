#Mechanic

Limit breaking is the process of taking the life energy and pushing it beyond its limits. This will take life from the user.

### Spellcasters
Spellcasters can cast a N-level spellslot in exchange for (semi-)permanently losing Nd4 of health.

### Martials
Martials can choose Advantage, Critical Hit, etc. For every option choosing, you lose a d4 of semi-permanent health.
A lot of it depends on the class.
