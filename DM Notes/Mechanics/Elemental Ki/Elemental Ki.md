#Mechanic

Someone/something's ki is decided at birth. The elements are [[DM Notes/Mechanics/Elemental Ki/water]], [[DM Notes/Mechanics/Elemental Ki/wood]], [[DM Notes/Mechanics/Elemental Ki/fire]], [[DM Notes/Mechanics/Elemental Ki/earth]], and [[DM Notes/Mechanics/Elemental Ki/metal]]. The element depends on the race for the most part, but it is also personality. A water genasi can have a fire element, but it is quite rare.
