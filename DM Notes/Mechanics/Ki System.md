#Mechanic

Every being has an innate life energy, some cultures call it Ki, others call it Chakra or [[Soul]]. The Ki system refers to the energy that flows and fuels most actions that one can take. It is the source in which they do things like cast spells, but also attack physically. 

For the most part, it is similar to what the 5e rules are, but there are some exceptions. 
Whenever a creature doesn't have enough energy, it can sacrifice some of its life force to push themselves.
